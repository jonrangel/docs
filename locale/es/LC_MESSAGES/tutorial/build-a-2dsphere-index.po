"The first example creates a simple geospatial index on the location field "
"``loc``. The second example creates a compound index where the second field "
"contains non-location data. The third example creates an index where the "
"location field is not the primary field: the location field does not have to"
" be the first field in a ``2dsphere`` index. The fourth example creates a "
"compound index with three fields. You can include as many fields as you like"
" in a ``2dsphere`` index."
