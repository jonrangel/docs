"Indexes allow MongoDB to process and fulfill queries quickly by creating "
"small and efficient representations of the documents in a "
":term:`collection`. MongoDB creates an index on the ``_id`` field of every "
"collection by default, but allows users to create indexes for any collection"
" using on any field in a :term:`document`."
