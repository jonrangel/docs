"In addition to providing all the functionality of master-slave deployments, "
"replica sets are also more robust for production use. Master-slave "
"replication preceded replica sets and made it possible have a large number "
"of non-master (i.e. slave) nodes, as well as to restrict replicated "
"operations to only a single database; however, master-slave replication "
"provides less redundancy and does not automate failover. See :ref:`replica-"
"set-equivalent` for a replica set configuration that is equivalent to "
"master-slave replication.  If you wish to convert an existing master-slave "
"deployment to a replica set, see :ref:`convert-master-slave-to-replica-set`."
