"MongoDB stores data in the form of *documents*, which are JSON-like field "
"and value pairs. Documents are analogous to structures in programming "
"languages that associate keys with values, where keys may hold other pairs "
"of keys and values (e.g. dictionaries, hashes, maps, and associative "
"arrays). Formally, MongoDB documents are :term:`BSON` documents, which is a "
"binary representation of :term:`JSON` with additional type information. For "
"more information, see :doc:`/core/document`."

"In MongoDB a query targets a specific collection of documents. Queries "
"specify criteria, or conditions, that identify the documents that MongoDB "
"returns to the clients. A query may include a *projection* that specifies "
"the fields from the matching documents to return. You can optionally modify "
"queries to impose limits, skips, and sort orders."

"To enhance the performance of common queries and updates, MongoDB has full "
"support for secondary indexes. These indexes allow applications to store a "
"*view* of a portion of the collection in an efficient data structure. Most "
"indexes store an ordered representation of all values of a field or a group "
"of fields. Indexes may also :ref:`enforce uniqueness <index-type-unique>`, "
"store objects in a :doc:`geospatial representation </applications"
