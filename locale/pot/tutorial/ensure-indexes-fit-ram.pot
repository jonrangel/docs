msgid "Indexes do not have to fit *entirely* into RAM in all cases. If the value of the indexed field increments with every insert, and most queries select recently added documents; then MongoDB only needs to keep the parts of the index that hold the most recent or \"right-most\" values in RAM. This allows for efficient index use for read and write operations and minimize the amount of RAM required to support the index."
