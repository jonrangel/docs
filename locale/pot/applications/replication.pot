msgid "Users may configure :term:`read preference` on a per-connection basis to prefer that the read operations return on the :term:`secondary` members. If clients configure the :term:`read preference` to permit secondary reads, read operations cannot return from :term:`secondary` members that have not replicated more recent updates or operations. When reading from a secondary, a query may return data that reflects a previous state."

msgid "This behavior is sometimes characterized as :term:`eventual consistency` because the secondary member's state will *eventually* reflect the primary's state and MongoDB cannot guarantee :term:`strict consistency` for read operations from secondary members."

# 28df03721eb64eedae0ee3fbad5a760f
msgid "To guarantee consistency for reads from secondary members, you can configure the :term:`client` and :term:`driver` to ensure that write operations succeed on all members before completing successfully. See :doc:`/core/write-concern` for more information. Additionally, such configuration can help prevent :doc:`/core/replica-set-rollbacks` during a failover."
