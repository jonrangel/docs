msgid "The output of :pipeline:`$group` depends on how you define groups. Begin by specifying an identifier (i.e. an ``_id`` field) for the group you're creating with this pipeline. For this ``_id`` field, you can specify various expressions, including a single field from the documents in the pipeline, a computed value from a previous stage, a document that consists of multiple fields, and other valid expressions, such as constant or subdocument fields. You can use :pipeline:`$project` operators in expressions for the ``_id`` field."
