msgid "In the above aggregation :pipeline:`$project` selects (inclusively) the ``author``, ``title``, and ``tags`` fields, as well as the ``_id`` field implicitly. Then the pipeline passes the results of the projection to the :pipeline:`$unwind` operator, which will unwind the ``tags`` field. This operation may return a sequence of documents that resemble the following for a collection that contains one document holding a ``tags`` field with an array of 3 items."
