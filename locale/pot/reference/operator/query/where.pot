msgid "Use the :query:`$where` operator to pass either a string containing a JavaScript expression or a full JavaScript function to the query system. The :query:`$where` provides greater flexibility, but requires that the database processes the JavaScript expression or function for *each* document in the collection. Reference the document in the JavaScript expression or function using either ``this`` or ``obj`` ."

msgid ":query:`$where` evaluates JavaScript and cannot take advantage of indexes. Therefore, query performance improves when you express your query using the standard MongoDB operators (e.g., :query:`$gt`, :query:`$in`)."

msgid "In general, you should use :query:`$where` only when you can't express your query using another operator. If you must use :query:`$where`, try to include at least one other standard query operator to filter the result set. Using :query:`$where` alone requires a table scan."
