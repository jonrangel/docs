msgid ":operator:`$explain` runs the actual query to determine the result. Although there are some differences between running the query with :operator:`$explain` and running without, generally, the performance will be similar between the two. So, if the query is slow, the :operator:`$explain` operation is also slow."

msgid "Additionally, the :operator:`$explain` operation reevaluates a set of candidate query plans, which may cause the :operator:`$explain` operation to perform differently than a normal query. As a result, these operations generally provide an accurate account of *how* MongoDB would perform the query, but do not reflect the length of these queries."
