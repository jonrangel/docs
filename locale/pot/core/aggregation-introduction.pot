msgid "*Aggregations* are operations that process data records and return computed results. MongoDB provides a rich set of aggregation operations that examine and perform calculations on the data sets. Running data aggregation on the :program:`mongod` instance simplifies application code and limits resource requirements."

msgid "MongoDB 2.2 introduced a new :doc:`aggregation framework </core/aggregation-pipeline>`, modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into an aggregated result."

msgid "Other pipeline operations provide tools for grouping and sorting documents by specific field or fields as well as tools for aggregating the contents of arrays, including arrays of documents. In addition, pipeline stages can use :ref:`operators <aggregation-expression-operators>` for tasks such as calculating the average or concatenating a string."

# 299cd05776204a6c9cf3e92c2b5aa0fb
msgid "MongoDB also provides :doc:`map-reduce </core/map-reduce>` operations to perform aggregation. In general, map-reduce operations have two phases: a *map* stage that processes each document and *emits* one or more objects for each input document, and *reduce* phase that combines the output of the map operation. Optionally, map-reduce can have a *finalize* stage to make final modifications to the result. Like other aggregation operations, map-reduce can specify a query condition to select the input documents as well as sort and limit the results."

msgid "Map-reduce uses custom JavaScript functions to perform the map and reduce operations, as well as the optional *finalize* operation. While the custom JavaScript provide great flexibility compared to the aggregation pipeline, in general, map-reduce is less efficient and more complex than the aggregation pipeline."

msgid "Starting in MongoDB 2.4, certain :program:`mongo` shell functions and properties are inaccessible in map-reduce operations. MongoDB 2.4 also provides support for multiple JavaScript operations to run at the same time. Before MongoDB 2.4, JavaScript code executed in a single thread, raising concurrency issues for map-reduce."

msgid "For a number of common :doc:`single purpose aggregation operations </core/single-purpose-aggregation>`, MongoDB provides special purpose database commands. These common aggregation operations are: returning a count of matching documents, returning the distinct values for a field, and grouping data based on the values of a field. All of these operations aggregate documents from a single collection. While these operations provide simple access to common aggregation processes, they lack the flexibility and capabilities of the aggregation pipeline and map-reduce."
