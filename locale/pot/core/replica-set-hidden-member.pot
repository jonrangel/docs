msgid "A hidden member maintains a copy of the :term:`primary's <primary>` data set but is **invisible** to client applications. Hidden members are good for workloads with different usage patterns from the other members in the :term:`replica set`. Hidden members are always :ref:`priority 0 members <replica-set-secondary-only-members>` and **cannot become primary**. The :method:`db.isMaster()` method does not display hidden members. Hidden members, however, **do vote** in :ref:`elections <replica-set-elections>`."

As a result, these members receive no traffic other than basic replication. Use hidden members for dedicated tasks such as reporting and backups. :doc:`Delayed members </core/replica-set-delayed-member>` should be hidden."
