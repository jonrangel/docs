msgid "MongoDB Enterprise includes an auditing capability for :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances. The auditing facility allows administrators and users to track system activity for deployments with multiple users and applications. The auditing facility can write audit events to the console, the :term:`syslog`, a JSON file, or a BSON file. For details on the audit log messages, see :doc:`/reference/audit-message`."
