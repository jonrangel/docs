============================
Enable Client Access Control
============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Enabling access control on a MongoDB instance restricts access to the
instance by requiring that users identify themselves when connecting. In
this procedure, you enable access control and then create the instance's
first user, which must be a user administrator. The user administrator
grants further access to the instance by creating additional users.

Considerations
--------------

If you create the user administrator before enabling access control,
MongoDB disables the :ref:`localhost exception <localhost-exception>`.
In that case, you must use the
":doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication-without-bypass`" procedure to
enable access control.

This procedure uses the :ref:`localhost exception
<localhost-exception>` to allow you to create the first user after
enabling authentication. See :ref:`localhost-exception` and
:doc:`/core/authentication` for more information.

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-authentication.rst

Next Steps
----------

If you need to disable access control for any reason, restart the process
without the :setting:`~security.authorization` or
:setting:`~security.keyFile` setting.
