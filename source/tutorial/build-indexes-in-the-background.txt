Build Indexes in the Background
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

By default, MongoDB builds indexes in the foreground, which prevents all
read and write operations to the database while the index
builds. Also, no operation that requires a read or write lock on all
databases (e.g. :command:`listDatabases`) can occur during a
foreground index build.

:ref:`Background index construction <index-creation-background>` allows
read and write operations to continue while building the index.


.. seealso:: :doc:`/core/indexes` and :doc:`/administration/indexes`
   for more information.

Considerations
--------------

Background index builds take longer to complete and result
in an index that is *initially* larger, or less compact, than an index
built in the foreground. Over time, the compactness of indexes built in
the background will approach foreground-built indexes.

After MongoDB finishes building the index, background-built indexes
are functionally identical to any other index.

Procedure
---------

To create an index in the background, add the ``background`` argument
to the :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` operation, as in the
following index:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { a: 1 }, { background: true } )

Consider the section on :ref:`background index construction
<index-creation-background>` for more information about these indexes
and their implications.
