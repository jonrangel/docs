Create a ``2dsphere`` Index
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

To create a geospatial index for GeoJSON-formatted data, use the
:method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` method and set the
value of the location field for your collection to ``2dsphere``. A
``2dsphere`` index can be a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>`
and does not require the location field to be the first field indexed.

To create the index use the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.points.ensureIndex( { <location field> : "2dsphere" } )

The following are four example commands for creating a ``2dsphere`` index:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.points.ensureIndex( { loc : "2dsphere" } )
   db.points.ensureIndex( { loc : "2dsphere" , type : 1 } )
   db.points.ensureIndex( { rating : 1 , loc : "2dsphere" } )
   db.points.ensureIndex( { loc : "2dsphere" , rating : 1 , category : -1 } )

The first example creates a simple geospatial index on the location
field ``loc``. The second example creates a compound index where the
second field contains non-location data. The third example creates an
index where the location field is not the primary field: the location
field does not have to be the first field in a ``2dsphere`` index. The
fourth example creates a compound index with three fields. You can
include as many fields as you like in a ``2dsphere`` index.
