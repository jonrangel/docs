Troubleshoot Sharded Clusters
=============================

This section describes common strategies for troubleshooting
:term:`sharded cluster` deployments.

.. _config-database-string-error:

Config Database String Error
----------------------------

.. DOCS-1143

Start all :program:`mongos` instances in a sharded cluster with an identical
:setting:`~sharding.configDB` string. If a :program:`mongos` instance tries to
connect to the sharded cluster with a :setting:`~sharding.configDB` string that
does not *exactly* match the string used by the other :program:`mongos`
instances, including the order of the hosts, the following errors occur:

.. code-block:: none

   could not initialize sharding on connection

And:

.. code-block:: none

   mongos specified a different config database string

To solve the issue, restart the :program:`mongos` with the correct
string.

Cursor Fails Because of Stale Config Data
-----------------------------------------

.. DOCS-425

A query returns the following warning when one or more of the
:program:`mongos` instances has not yet updated its cache of the
cluster's metadata from the :term:`config database`:

.. code-block:: none

   could not initialize cursor across all shards because : stale config detected

This warning *should* not propagate back to your application. The
warning will repeat until all the :program:`mongos` instances refresh
their caches. To force an instance to refresh its cache, run the
:dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` command.

Avoid Downtime when Moving Config Servers
