Read Operations to Sharded Clusters
-----------------------------------

:term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` allow you to partition a data
set among a cluster of :program:`mongod` instances in a way that is
nearly transparent to the application. For an overview of sharded
clusters, see the :doc:`/sharding` section of this manual.

For a sharded cluster, applications issue operations to one of the
:program:`mongos` instances associated with the cluster.

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster.rst

Read operations on sharded clusters are most efficient when directed to
a specific shard. Queries to sharded collections should include the
collection's :ref:`shard key <sharding-shard-key>`. When a query
includes a shard key, the :program:`mongos` can use cluster metadata
from the :ref:`config database <sharding-config-server>` to route the
queries to shards.

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-targeted-query.rst

If a query does not include the shard key, the :program:`mongos` must
direct the query to *all* shards in the cluster. These *scatter
gather* queries can be inefficient. On larger clusters, scatter gather
queries are unfeasible for routine operations.

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-scatter-gather-query.rst

For more information on read operations in sharded clusters, see the
:doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-query-router` and :ref:`sharding-shard-key`
sections.

Read Operations to Replica Sets
-------------------------------

:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` use :term:`read preferences <read
preference>` to determine where and how to route read operations to
members of the replica set. By default, MongoDB always reads data from
a replica set's :term:`primary`. You can modify that behavior by
changing the :ref:`read preference mode
<replica-set-read-preference-modes>`.

You can configure the :ref:`read preference mode
<replica-set-read-preference-modes>` on a per-connection or
per-operation basis to allow reads from :term:`secondaries
<secondary>` to:

- reduce latency in multi-data-center deployments,

- improve read throughput by distributing high read-volumes (relative
  to write volume),

- for backup operations, and/or

- to allow reads during :ref:`failover <replica-set-failover>`
  situations.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-read-preference.rst

Read operations from secondary members of replica sets are not
guaranteed to reflect the current state of the primary, and the state
of secondaries will trail the primary by some amount of time. Often,
applications don't rely on this kind of strict consistency, but
application developers should always consider the needs of their
application before setting read preference.

For more information on read preference or on the read preference
modes, see :doc:`/core/read-preference` and
:ref:`replica-set-read-preference-modes`.
