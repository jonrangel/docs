The :program:`mongo` shell is an interactive JavaScript shell for
MongoDB, and is part of all `MongoDB distributions
<http://www.mongodb.org/downloads>`_. This section provides an
introduction to the shell, and outlines key functions, operations, and
use of the :program:`mongo` shell. Also consider :doc:`/faq/mongo` and
the :doc:`shell method </reference/method>` and other relevant
:doc:`reference material </reference>`.

.. note:: Most examples in the :doc:`MongoDB Manual </contents>` use
   the :program:`mongo` shell; however, many :doc:`drivers
   </applications/drivers>` provide similar interfaces to MongoDB.
