.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: cursor.limit()

   Use the :method:`~cursor.limit()` method on a cursor to specify the maximum
   number of documents the cursor will return. :method:`~cursor.limit()` is
   analogous to the ``LIMIT`` statement in a SQL database.

   .. note::

      You must apply :method:`~cursor.limit()` to the cursor before
      retrieving any documents from the database.

   Use :method:`~cursor.limit()` to maximize performance and prevent
   MongoDB from returning more results than required for processing.

   A :method:`~cursor.limit()` value of 0 (i.e. :method:`.limit(0)
   <cursor.limit()>`) is equivalent to setting no limit. A negative
   limit is similar to a positive limit, but a negative limit prevents
   the creation of a cursor such that only a single batch of results is
   returned. As such, with a negative limit, if the limited result set
   does not fit into a single batch, the number of documents received
   will be less than the limit.
