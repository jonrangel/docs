.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. method:: cursor.limit()

   Use the :method:`~cursor.limit()` method on a cursor to specify the maximum
   number of documents the cursor will return. :method:`~cursor.limit()` is
   analogous to the ``LIMIT`` statement in a SQL database.

   .. note::

      You must apply :method:`~cursor.limit()` to the cursor before
      retrieving any documents from the database.

   Use :method:`~cursor.limit()` to maximize performance and prevent
   MongoDB from returning more results than required for processing.

Behavior
--------

Supported Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The behavior of :method:`~cursor.limit()` is undefined for values less
than -2\ :sup:`31` and greater than 2\ :sup:`31`.

Negative Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :method:`~cursor.limit()` value of 0 (i.e. :method:`.limit(0)
<cursor.limit()>`) is equivalent to setting no limit. A negative
limit is similar to a positive limit, but a negative limit prevents
the creation of a cursor such that only a single batch of results is
returned. As such, with a negative limit, if the limited result set
does not fit into a single batch, the number of documents received
will be less than the limit.
