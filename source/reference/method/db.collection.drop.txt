   :dbcommand:`drop` command.

   :method:`db.collection.drop()` takes no arguments and will produce
   an error if called with any arguments.

   This method also removes any indexes associated with the dropped
   collection.

      This method obtains a write lock on the affected database and
      will block other operations until it has completed.
