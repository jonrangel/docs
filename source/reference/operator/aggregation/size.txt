$size (aggregation)
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 2.6

Definition
----------

.. expression:: $size

   Counts and returns the total the number of items in an array.
   Consider the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { <field>: { $size: <array> } }

Example
-------

Given a ``survey`` collection that records town occupants by
household, and that includes documents similar to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("524d82e535edde4707c684c5"),
     "household" : "Carter",
     "st_num" : 300,
     "street" : "North Bond Street",
     "occupants" : [
         "Amy",
         "Donnel",
         "Jack",
         "James"
     ]
   }

The following aggregation pipeline operation counts the number of
residents on each street. The pipeline groups documents according to
the ``street`` field and uses the :query:`$size` operator to count
the entries in each household's ``occupants`` array. The pipeline
uses :group:`$sum` to add the number of residents on each street.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey.aggregate(
      [
         {
            $group: {
               _id: "$street",
               numResidents: { $sum: {$size: "$occupants" } }
            }
         }
      ]
   )
