===========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: movePrimary

   In a :term:`sharded cluster`, this command reassigns the database's
   :term:`primary shard`, which holds all un-sharded collections in
   the database. :dbcommand:`movePrimary` is an administrative command
   that is only available for :program:`mongos` instances. Only use
   :dbcommand:`movePrimary` when removing a shard from a sharded
   cluster.

   :dbcommand:`movePrimary` changes the primary shard for a
   database in the cluster metadata, and migrates all un-sharded
   collections to the specified shard. Use the command with the
   following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { movePrimary : "test", to : "shard0001" }

   When the command returns, the database's primary location will
   shift to the designated :term:`shard`. To fully decommission a
   shard, use the :dbcommand:`removeShard` command.

Considerations
--------------

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

Only use :dbcommand:`movePrimary` when:

- the database does not contain any collections, *or*

- you have drained all sharded collections using the
  :dbcommand:`removeShard` command.

Use
~~~

If you use the :dbcommand:`movePrimary` command to move un-sharded
collections, you must either restart all :program:`mongos` instances,
or use the :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` command on all
:program:`mongos` instances before writing any data to the
cluster. This action notifies the :program:`mongos` of the new shard
for the database.

If you do not update the :program:`mongos` instances' metadata cache
after using :dbcommand:`movePrimary`, the :program:`mongos` may not
write data to the correct shard, to recover you must manually
intervene.
