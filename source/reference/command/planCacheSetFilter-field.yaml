   The query predicate associated with the index filter. Together with
   the ``sort`` and the ``projection``, the ``query`` predicate make up
   the :term:`query shape` for the specified index filter.

   Only the structure of the predicate, including the field names, are
   significant; the values in the query predicate are
   insignificant. As such, query predicates cover similar queries that
   differ only in the values.
