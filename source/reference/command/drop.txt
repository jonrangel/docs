.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: drop

   The :dbcommand:`drop` command removes an entire collection from a
   database. The command has following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { drop: <collection_name> }

   The :program:`mongo` shell provides the equivalent helper method
   :method:`db.collection.drop()`.

   This command also removes any indexes associated with the dropped
   collection.

   .. warning::

      This command obtains a write lock on the affected database and
      will block other operations until it has completed.
